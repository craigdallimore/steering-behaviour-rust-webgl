## TODO

- [x] Set up a server with an HTML page
- [x] Produce a wasm hello world
- [ ] Get livereload working with wasm

- [ ] Migrate the DOM bindings, etc from the javascript project
- [ ] Find a way to optimise JS size
- [ ] Find a way to optimise wasm size [link](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/game-of-life/code-size.html)
