## TODO

- [ ] Set up a server with an HTML page
- [ ] Produce a wasm hello world
- [ ] Get livereload working with wasm
- [ ] Decide on whether to use canvas, webGL or webGPU
  - [ ] Probably canvas - the others are likely to be too great a distraction
- [ ] Migrate the DOM bindings, etc from the javascript project
